Project Title: Sudoku Solver with Backtracking Algorithm and Image Export

Project Description:
Developed a Sudoku solver application that utilizes a backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles of varying complexity. The project encompasses the creation of a Python script that employs recursive backtracking to intelligently fill in empty cells, adhering to Sudoku rules and constraints. Additionally, the project includes a feature that exports an image of the solved Sudoku grid, providing users with visual validation of the completed puzzle.

Key Achievements:

Implemented a Python program that employs a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles, showcasing strong algorithmic and logical thinking skills.
Created an intuitive command-line interface that allows users to input Sudoku puzzles and view the solved results.
Enhanced the solver with an innovative feature to export an image of the solved Sudoku, providing users with visual confirmation of the solution.
Demonstrated proficiency in interactive program development, problem-solving, and visualization by combining Sudoku solving with image export functionality.
Skills Applied:
Python, Algorithms, Backtracking, Problem Solving, Command-Line Interface, Image Manipulation, Visualization

Outcome:
The completed Sudoku solver project with image export not only offers a robust solution to Sudoku puzzle challenges but also enriches user experience through visual feedback. The project showcases a comprehensive set of skills, including algorithmic proficiency, interactive program development, and innovative feature integration.
